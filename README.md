This simple breakout board is designed to fit either the TCRT5000 or the VCNT2020. A basic
implementation of the Vishay application notes is used to enable engineers to quickly evaluate the
performance of these sensors. Many very useful sensors are available in packages that are difficult to
quickly evaluate so we hope this is a meaningful addition to your toolbox.
